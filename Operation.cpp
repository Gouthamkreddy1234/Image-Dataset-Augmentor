/**
 * Functions not defined here since Template functions, including member functions,
 *  must be written entirely in the header files. This means that if you have a template class, its implementation
 *  must be entirely in a header file. This is because the compiler needs to have access to the entire
 * template definition (not just the signature) in order to generate code for each instantiation of the template.
