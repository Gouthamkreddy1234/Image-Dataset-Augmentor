Library Design using C++ Final Project

Using the library - https://github.com/md81544/libjpeg_cpp/ (https://www.martyndavis.com/?tag=libjpeg)



<br>
This is a wrapper around the standard libjpeg

We will be wrapping our code aroud the this library since writing our own wrapper might be tedious.

Before starting, please install libjpeg using - 
<br>
brew install libjpeg or brew install libjpeg-dev
