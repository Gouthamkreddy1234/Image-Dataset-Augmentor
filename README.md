# Image-Augmentation-Library
Library Design using C++ Final Project

Using the library - https://github.com/md81544/libjpeg_cpp/ (https://www.martyndavis.com/?tag=libjpeg)


<br>
This is a wrapper around the standard libjpeg

<br>

We will be using this Wrapper instead of the standard classes that Jpeglib.h offers since it is way more simpler and writing our own wrapper might be tedious.

Before starting, please install libjpeg using - 
<br>
brew install libjpeg or brew install libjpeg-dev
